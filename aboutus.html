	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>The Dandy Brewing Company is Calgary's original small brewery. Although it has grown a little, it's still small at heart. We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in small batches.</p>
	<p>Our unique approach to brewing and keen eye to every detail fosters creativity in both our recipes and beer styles.</p>
	<p>On site, we are pleased to offer a unique brewing experience, featuring a full service tasting room with an exquisite menu of fine dining drinking food, a curated selection of cocktails, glass pours of selected wines, and 20 taps of Dandy beers.</p>
	<p>We share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, experiences, and personal touches that make the real ale experience so special.</p>
